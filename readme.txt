# Python Book Library

This is a small Python script that implements a book library. The script uses a dictionary to store information about books, including ISBN, title, author, and available quantity. It also includes functions to interact with the library, such as adding books, checking loan availability, and searching for books by title.

## How to Use

1. Run the Python script in your preferred development environment.

2. You will be presented with several options to interact with the library:
   - `library_details(x)`: Print details of the books in the library.
   - `add_books(x)`: Allows you to add a book to the library or update the quantity if the book already exists.
   - `loaning(x)`: Check if a book is available for loan, either by ISBN or title.
   - `search_isbn(x)`: Search for the ISBN of a book based on its title.

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform your desired operations.
